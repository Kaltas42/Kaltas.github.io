Hi, my name is Colin Tang, an aspiring graphic designer and illustrator.
I'm someone who enjoys creating content through illustrations and animations.
I have experiences in projects that involves industries such as Spicer & Direct paper and the Australian Defense Force for my designs.
These opportunities helped developed me more than just a graphic designer. Instead of just visually drawing the ideas, it is about bringing people's vision into a reality.
